This is a gem `vcr` demo app. The app shows current weather of Ho Chi Minh city when you access the root path.

# Demo guide

If you read the code from the `HomeController`, you will know that every single time you load the root page, the app call API to get the weather data. In testing, I use `vcr` gem to record the API request & response to a cassete file. You will code a real HTTP request for the first request for the recording purpose. After then you can disconnect your internet connection and your test still run smoothly since `vcr` replaying the record file.

1. First, run the test to make sure everything works fine: `bundle exec rspec`
2. Then try to disable/disconnect your internet connection and run the test again. It should still pass because `vcr` would replaying the record file.
3. Go to this file: `spec/requests/home_spec.rb` and:
  * Change value of `skip` option to `true` for context "when using gem `vcr`" 
  * Change value of `skip` option to `false` for context "when not using gem `vcr`"
4. Run the test again. This time the test should fail and raise error like the picture below. This error will occur when you try to have a real HTTP to outside without "notifying" `vcr`. You need to put the code that occur HTTP request in the `VCR.use_cassette` block.
